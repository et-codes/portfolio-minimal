I had my first contact with a computer in 6th grade. Our classroom had a Commodore PET, and I showed such a strong interest in it that our pricipal allowed me to take it home on weekends. I still remember that magical feeling when I wrote my first BASIC program that animated text characters on the screen.

Since then, I've always had a love of computers and computing. I got a degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering, where I learned C, assembly, and digital logic. Later on I learned Python, and have recently been focusing on full-stack web development. My engineering and management career has taken me in diverse directions, but I've always been drawn to projects that involve technology and computing.

When I'm not working on coding projects, I play the drums, which is another life-long passion of mine. Like coding, playing music allows me to get into that "flow-state", where the outside world disappears and I am able to focus my mind completely.

I live in sunny El Paso, Texas with my beautiful wife and precocious son.
